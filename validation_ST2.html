                <h2 id="home">Profile Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>The Home Page layout is designed to provide an intuitive, user-friendly experience using HTML and CSS. The top section features a header, which includes the website’s logo, title, and a navigation bar for easy access to other pages. The hero section follows, serving as the main focal point with a prominent image or background and a call to action.

The main content area consists of distinct sections, organized into blocks or cards that present key information such as services or updates. These sections are styled for clarity, using consistent typography, spacing, and background colors to ensure readability.

At the bottom, the footer provides essential information, including contact details and links to social media or other important pages. CSS ensures a responsive layout using Flexbox or Grid, adapting the design for various screen sizes. Hover effects enhance interactivity, while modern fonts and clean colors maintain a professional and accessible aesthetic.

This design emphasizes both functionality and visual appeal, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices. The header and footer contribute to a balanced and organized page layout </p>
                
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Accessibility is a priority on the Profile Page, achieved through thoughtful design choices. Descriptive alt text accompanies all images, making them interpretable by screen readers, while semantic HTML elements like header and section improve navigation for assistive technologies. Text contrasts sharply with the background for readability, and buttons are styled with clear focus indicators, ensuring they’re navigable via keyboard. These steps create an inclusive experience for all users, regardless of ability.</p>
                
                <h3>Link to the validation page</h3>
                <p><a href="validation_ST0.html#splashVal">Include a link to the validation page</a>, use the marker to jump to the corresponding section of the validation page.</p>

                <h3>Link to the page</h3>
                <p><a href="home.html">Include a link to the actual page you describe.</a></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="table">Table</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>The Table Page layout was designed to display data in a structured and accessible manner using HTML and CSS. The table is divided into three main sections: a header, body, and footer. The header section contains the title row, with bold text and distinct background colors for clarity. The body section holds the data, arranged in rows and cells. The footer section displays summary or total data.CSS is employed to enhance the table's appearance and usability. Borders are applied to separate table elements, and border-collapse ensures a seamless visual presentation. Padding in the cells improves readability, while text alignment is tailored for appropriate data presentation. Hover effects provide interactivity by changing the row background color, and nth-child selectors alternate row colors to improve legibility.To ensure responsiveness, media queries are used to adjust the table layout on smaller screens, allowing horizontal scrolling or column stacking for mobile users. This approach ensures the table is both functional and visually appealing across devices.This design creates a clear, organized, and user-friendly interface for displaying large datasets in a structured table format.</p>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>To make the Sitemap Page accessible, the nav element signals its navigational role to screen readers, while links are designed for keyboard navigation with visible focus states. High contrast between text and background enhances readability, ensuring the page is usable for all visitors, including those with visual impairments.</p>

                <h3>Link to the validation page</h3>
                <p><a href="validation_ST0.html#volunteerVal">Include a link to the validation page</a>, use the marker to jump to the corresponding section of the validation page.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>The Content Page is crafted to deliver articles, media, or other primary content in an engaging manner, built with a robust HTML structure and dynamic CSS styling. A header element introduces the page with a title and brief description, while article elements wrap individual content pieces, such as blog posts or videos, providing semantic clarity. A looping background video, set to autoplay and muted, adds visual interest, styled to cover the entire screen with an overlay to maintain text readability. Div containers organize text, images, and buttons within each article, with buttons offering actions like "Read More" for interactivity. CSS brings this to life with Flexbox aligning content blocks flexibly across screen sizes, and keyframe animations fade in elements smoothly for a polished effect. Typography prioritizes readability with larger headings and a comfortable line height, while hover effects on buttons shift their color and scale for user feedback. The video background is styled to fit perfectly, overlaid with a semi-transparent layer to ensure text stands out against the dynamic visuals.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Accessibility on the Content Page is addressed by including alt text for images and aria-labels for buttons, ensuring screen readers can interpret interactive elements. The muted background video avoids disrupting assistive technologies, while semantic tags like article and header enhance content structure. Responsive design adapts the layout for various devices, and sufficient contrast between text and background supports users with visual impairments.</p>

                <h3>Link to the validation page</h3>
                <p><a href="new1.html>Include a link to the validation page</a>, use the marker to jump to the corresponding section of the validation page.</p>

                <h3>Link to the page</h3>
                <p><a href="content.html">Include a link to the actual page you describe.</a></p>

                <h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>Creating these pages presented several challenges that deepened my understanding of web development. On the Content Page, getting the background video to scale correctly across devices was tricky, but applying object-fit: cover and media queries resolved the issue, teaching me the importance of testing visual elements thoroughly. The Profile Page’s card alignment initially faltered with uneven sizes, which I fixed by tweaking Flexbox properties, reinforcing the need for precise layout planning. On the Sitemap Page, nested links looked cluttered on mobile, so I adjusted padding and font sizes, learning to prioritize mobile-first design. Accessibility also posed a hurdle, requiring me to revisit images and navigation to add proper alt text and keyboard support, guided by WCAG standards—a process that underscored the value of inclusivity from the start. These experiences taught me to balance aesthetics with functionality, plan layouts carefully, and test across devices, ultimately enhancing my skills in building user-friendly, accessible websites.</p>
